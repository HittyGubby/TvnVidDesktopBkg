# TightVNC as Dynamic Desktop
TightVNC remote desktop as your windows dynamic desktop!

Currently doesnt support multi-window backgrounding, and not about to do so

and for a better performance, suggest to fullscreen and launch(automation not intended cuz i dont think tvnc would do so?

Anyways ENJOY :)

## Bugs

                    Glitches exiting, icon layer displacements, etc.
